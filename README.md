# deno-oak-routing-ctrl-oas

starter template for web service based on Deno + Oak + oak-routing-ctrl, with Open API Spec validation

## Runtime Notes

This codebase supports
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/installation/) out of the box.

It is possible to convert into other runtimes (e.g. Node.js, Bun, or Cloudflare
Workers). For further details here please consule
[oak-routing-ctrl documentation](https://github.com/Thesephi/oak-routing-ctrl?tab=readme-ov-file#other-runtimes).

If you're on [Google IDX](https://idx.dev/), everything is already set up for you (just clone this repo as-is).

## Quick start

```bash
# with Deno 1.46.3 or above
deno run dev # executes task 'dev' declared in deno.jsonc
```
