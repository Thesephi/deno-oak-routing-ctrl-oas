## Runtime Notes

This codebase supports
[Deno](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/fundamentals/installation/) out of the box.

It is possible to convert into other runtimes (e.g. Node.js, Bun, or Cloudflare
Workers). For further details here please consule
[oak-routing-ctrl documentation](https://github.com/Thesephi/oak-routing-ctrl?tab=readme-ov-file#other-runtimes).

If you're on replit, everything is already set up for you.
